<h3>Overview</h3>
This app was developed as part of a software development course assignment. In this assignment, I used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of LOONEY TUNES character.

To complete this assignment, I called the GIPHY API using AJAX and translated the reponse by using JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of my site.
